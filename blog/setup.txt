Node.js can be used with WebSockets. There are various libraries available in Node.js that provide WebSocket server and client functionality.

One popular library for WebSocket communication in Node.js is ws. Here's an example of how you can use the ws library to create a WebSocket server:

Install the ws package by running the following command in your project directory:

Copy code
npm install ws
Create a file named server.js and add the following code:

javascript
Copy code
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 12345 });

wss.on('connection', ws => {
  console.log('Client connected');

  ws.on('message', message => {
    console.log('Received data:', message);

    // Send a response back to the client
    const response = 'Message received successfully!';
    ws.send(response);
  });

  ws.on('close', () => {
    console.log('Client disconnected');
  });
});

console.log('WebSocket server is listening...');
This code sets up a WebSocket server using the ws library. The server listens on port 12345. When a client establishes a WebSocket connection (connection event), the server logs the connection. When a message is received from a client (message event), the server logs the received data and sends a response back to the client. When a client disconnects (close event), the server logs the disconnection.

Run the server by executing the following command in the terminal:

Copy code
node server.js
The server will start running and will be ready to accept WebSocket connections on port 12345.

You can now connect to the WebSocket server using a WebSocket client or interact programmatically with the server using client-side JavaScript code. Remember to update the client-side code accordingly, setting the WebSocket URL to ws://localhost:12345 or the appropriate IP address and port of your WebSocket server.

The ws library provides both server and client functionality, allowing you to build WebSocket-based applications in Node.js.

Node.js can't run on the google drive.  Must run on a local drive.
